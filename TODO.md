# Duality Jam

## Bugs

- need to prevent changing/deactivating card when move turns into life (and also not change color)

## Features

- move card: select stone, select where to move
- water card: select placement, select facing
- automatic advancement at end of turn (skip first?)
- count kills
- step card: auto-move active disaster, select facing
- spread card: as two step cards
- fire card: as water but double speed
- fire stops at water
- water crosses through fire
- plague card: select placement (occupied), select facing
- wild card: select which card to copy, use that logic

- card info from text file
- more modular setup for card/board actions

- CARD COUNT MUST BE 2n+3
